Useless Dragon fights Teenage Wyvern, arrogant dragon that always mocked him. In this combat they exchange some Basic Attacks. After 2-3 rounds, Teenage Wyvern insults Useless Dragon, introducting to the player the Power Attack action, explaining whatever it implies. 

Useless Dragon defeats Teenage Wyvern in Draconid Stance(Aggressive Stance) and Teenage Wyvern starts crying.

Ruby Guard, elder brother of Teenage Wyvern is reknown Dragon that even Useless Dragon admires. Ruby Dragon joins the fights starting to hit Useless Dragon with Basic Attack that he cannot handle. He is therefore introduced to the Phoenix Stance(Defensive Stance) blocking as much damage as he can. After 2-3 turns, Ruby Guard take his smaller brother and leaves after saying: "if you touch my brother again I'll kill you".
